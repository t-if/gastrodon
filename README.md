# Gastrodon

![Gastrodon theme preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d44e306-dabb-4392-a68d-8f7e3e911c06)

A practical remix of [Chime](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme) for Obsidian 1.13+. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) is recommended.

## Installation

1. Install and enable [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).
2. Choose **Add a beta theme** and enter `https://github.com/t-if/gastrodon`.
3. Select **Gastrodon** under **Settings → Appearance → Themes**.

BRAT uses `theme-beta.css`. `theme.css` has the same features with my personal defaults.

## Differences from Chime

- Updated for current Obsidian layouts, callouts, and plugins.
- Adds inactive-pane dimming, hover-expanding ribbon, dark-mode media dimming, list and outline threading, seamless embeds, and banners.
- Builds in list grids/cards, tree lists, floating and multi-column callouts, alternate checkboxes, and priority tags.
- Adds styling for Bases, Commander, Dataview, Calendar, and Kanban.
- Removes Chime's legacy layouts, background images, `wiki-page`, `novel`, Novelist, Notion, Page Gallery, and other obsolete plugin rules.

Everything else is labeled under **Settings → Style Settings → Gastrodon**.

## Styling Reference

### Page Classes

Add these under the note's `cssclasses` property.

| Use | Classes |
| --- | --- |
| Width | `width-800`, `width-900`, `width-1000`, `width-1200`, `width-1600` |
| Cleanup | `no-backlinks`, `no-count`, `no-fold`, `clean-embed` |
| Banners | `banner`, `banner-fade` |
| Bases | `no-head`, `case-card`, `center-card`, `oneline`, `pokemonbox`, `musicshelf` |
| Dataview | `cards`, `cards-cols-1`–`cards-cols-8`, `table-100`, `trim-cols` |
| Text | `colorful-headings`, `colorful-headings-alt`, `underlined-highlight` |
| Headings | `h1-center`–`h6-center`, `h1-bottom-border`–`h6-bottom-border` |

`aside-left` and `aside-right` are HTML element classes for margin notes, not page classes.

### Banners & Images

```yaml
---
cssclasses: [banner, banner-fade]
---
```

```markdown
![[image.jpg|banner]]
```

Image aliases also support `center` and `right`.

### Lists

| Tag | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `#mcl/list-grid` | Column grid |
| `#mcl/list-card` | Card grid |
| `#tree-view` | Collapsible threaded tree |

Put the tag inside the list. It is hidden in Reading view.

### Callouts

```markdown
> [!issue] Issue
> What legal question must be resolved?

> [!note|float-right-small] Small floating note
> Text wraps around it.
```

| Group | Types or metadata |
| --- | --- |
| Legal | `facts`, `posture`, `issue`, `rule`, `analysis`, `conclusion`, `concurrence`, `dissent` |
| Other types | `email`, `conversation`, `conversation-outline`, `conversation-minimalist`, `timeline`, `theorem`, `polaroid` |
| Layout types | `blank`, `multi-column` |
| Colors | `gray`, `brown`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `cyan`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink` |
| Cleanup | `no-bg`, `no-background`, `no-icon`, `no-title`, `blank`, `wide`, `black-and-white`, `b-w` |
| Floats | `left`, `right`, `float-left`, `float-right`; add `-small`, `-medium`, or `-large` |
| Timeline | `horizontal`, `numbered`, `skip` |
| Email | `sep` |

### Checkboxes

Gastrodon supports standard checkboxes plus:

| Marker | Meaning     | Marker | Meaning   |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| `/`    | Incomplete  | `-`    | Canceled  |
| `>`    | Forwarded   | `<`    | Scheduled |
| `?`    | Question    | `!`    | Important |
| `*`    | Star        | `“`    | Quote     |
| `l`    | Location    | `b`    | Bookmark  |
| `i`    | Information | `I`    | Idea      |
| `S`    | Savings     | `p`    | Pro       |
| `c`    | Con         | `f`    | Fire      |
| `k`    | Key         | `w`    | Win       |
| `u`    | Up          | `d`    | Down      |
| `R`    | Rule        | `m`    | ???       |

Add `#A`, `#B`, or `#C` for high, medium, or low priority.
