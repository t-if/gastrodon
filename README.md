### Personal Theme

Created using [Chime ðŸ””](https://github.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme) by Bluemoondragon07. Several lot of people on in the Obsidian community have asked about how I achieved my Vault UI, and this servers as an easy way to share and document my CSS collection.

## Coloring Book

For the most part, I prefer using CSS snippets to messing with the original theme for aesthetic changes. This offers far more flexibility and efficiency for personal use. The simple snippets [here](https://github.com/t-if/gastrodon/tree/main/Snippets/Originals/Coloring%20Book) allow you to change colors of different UI elements in Style Settings, adding more fine-tuned customization options to any theme.
